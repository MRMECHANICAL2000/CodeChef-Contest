     it's not necessary that all the data given in question are alwasys used in the solution. for question A,B,C,D few details in question can be used to create an 
     solution. Always think of multiople input like , 0 array length, odd,even array length , -ve element in array , 0 in array. element >,<,>=,<=,= our condition.     
	My Code:
		"""
			#Afraid of this simple questoion in the contest dont know how to solve this and left contest without thinking again , shame less fellow!

Learening:
     Don't panic by looking the question think for a second you can find the loop hole to creack the question. IN this question to check wheather given string can be
     folded in K times.first we need to find the no of foldes. so first N//K will give no of fold. then count the occurance of '1','0' in string. then divide the no of
     occureance of '1' and '0' by no of fold , if it is %=0 means we can create an K fold string . then find no of occurance of 0,1 in each fold then using this one fold 
     you can create the entire lexorgical sting.   
	My Code Wrong answer:
               """
			#this solutin is from tutorial but i had no clue of the question. first i taught all string are need to be divided by 2 without clearly reading
			#the question and started to hard code the question. i taught of creating the entire string but tutorial create one fold use it to crete full string
